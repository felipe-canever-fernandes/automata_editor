# Automata Editor

> This is an old project from circa 2017 that I'm adding to GitHub to archive it.

This is an **unfinished editor** made in the game engine Construct 2 for **creating and testing automata**, i.e. finite-state machines. You can create states, connect them, and enter strings to see if they are accepted by the automaton, which is indicated by the background going from red to green.

There are also a couple of keyboard shortcuts that can be used with a selected state:

* `Del`: deletes the selected state;
* `i`: sets the selected state as the initial state;
* `f`: toggles the selected state as a final state.
